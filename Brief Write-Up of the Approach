### Brief Write-Up of the Approach

The project was developed to address the challenge of identifying and displaying products similar to uploaded images. The primary focus was implementing a user-friendly interface and leveraging algorithms to compute image similarity. 

The application uses React for building reusable and scalable UI components. TypeScript ensures strong typing, enhancing code quality and reducing runtime errors. The `ImageUploader` component handles image uploads and passes them to the backend (or utility functions) for processing. The `ProductGrid` component displays the dataset of products, ranked by their similarity to the uploaded image.

The `imageSimilarity.ts` utility function is a core feature, employing a pre-defined algorithm to compare uploaded images against product data. TailwindCSS was used for styling, ensuring a responsive and modern design.

The project was deployed using 'Vercel' to provide a live, accessible demo. Key challenges included implementing an efficient image similarity algorithm and handling large datasets, which were resolved through optimized algorithms and modular design.

This application is a robust foundation for expanding functionalities like advanced filtering, real-time database integration, or machine learning-based similarity algorithms.
